Does the crappy JavaScript tooling dance so you don't have to.

| What you get  | Package       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Builds        | [webpack][]   |
| Linting       | [standard][]  |
| Syntax        | [babel][]     |
| Testing       | [ava][]       |
| Types         | [flow][]      |

## Rationale

I got bored of all the things you have to set up to make JavaScript at least passable as a language so I thought I'd put a single tool together that orchestrated it all. I'm following in standard's footsteps and assuming defaults for everything for the sake of time and sanity. This will fit my workflow well, it may not fit yours. Maybe adjust things slightly or just adapt and get used to it.o

The name is from **S**hia **L**a**B**eouf's "Just Do It" motivational video, also it's unique and short. It's what I think of when I'm setting up webpack + babel for the third time that day.

## Features

 * [x] Production builds
 * [x] Modern syntax support
 * [x] Sourcemaps
 * [x] Development web server
 * [x] Hot module reloading (+ `react-hot-loader`)
 * [ ] Opinionated linting
 * [ ] Optional type checking
 * [ ] Testing
 * [ ] Test coverage
 * [ ] Performance benchmarks
 * [ ] Seamless Elm and / or ClojureSript build integration
 * [ ] SCSS and other assorted webpack loaders

## Installation

You can install `slb` globally with `npm install -g slb` or as a dev dependency local to your project. If you do the latter (which I recommend!) you can then set up a `Makefile` or build script that uses the local executable.

```bash
npm install --save-dev slb
./node_modules/.bin/slb --help
```

## Usage

### Bundle

```bash
slb bundle ./src/index.js ./dist/bundle.js
```

### Bundle, serve and watch with HMR

```bash
slb bundle --dev --base ./dist ./src/index.js ./dist/bundle.js
```
