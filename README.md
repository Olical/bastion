| What you get  | Package       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Builds        | [webpack][]   |
| Linting       | [standard][]  |
| Syntax        | [babel][]     |

| Types         | [flow][]      |

## Installation

You can install `slb` globally with `npm install -g slb` or as a dev dependency local to your project. If you do the latter (which I recommend!) you can then set up a `Makefile` or build script that uses the local executable.

```bash
npm install --save-dev slb
./node_modules/.bin/slb --help
```
